        <h1>Next Steps after not being accepted into Psy.D. program.</h1>
        <main>
            <p>
                    I recently applied to, and was not accepted to, a Psy.D. 
                    program. I'm an older, returning student, and I have a BS 
                    in Addiction Psychology from Kaplan University Online. 
                    I understand why I wasn't accepted to the program, 
                    but I'd like to take steps to be more competitive for future applications. 
                    One large element missing from my resume was research involvement; I'm interested in participating in 
                    research, but I don't think I have the correct academic affiliations for research opportunities just being available.
            </p>
            <P>
                    There are no opportunities for research in my workplace, and most of the local postings I see want researchers / administrative 
                    assistants. I'd like something that guarantees attachment to actual research, if it's out there. Is anyone aware of opportunities 
                    to conduct research without affiliation with an academic entity? Or opportunities for professionals to conduct or assist with 
                    research outside of academic institutions?
            </P>
