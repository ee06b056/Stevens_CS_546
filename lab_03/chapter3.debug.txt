chapter come away come away for a moment after mr and mrs darling left the house the nightlights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly they were awfully nice little nightlights and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see peter but wendys light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also and before they could close their mouths all the three went out there was another light in the room now a thousand times brighter than the nightlights and in the time we have taken to say this it had been in all the drawers in the nursery looking for peters shadow rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing it was a girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage she was slightly inclined to embonpoint plump hourglass figure a moment after the fairys entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars and peter dropped in he had carried tinker bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust tinker bell he called softly after making sure that the children were asleep tink where are you she was in a jug for the moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug before oh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where they put my shadow the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him it is the fairy language you ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before tink said that the shadow was in the big box she meant the chest of drawers and peter jumped at the drawers scattering their contents to the floor with both hands as kings toss hapence to the crowd in a moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot that he had shut tinker bell up in the drawer if he thought at all but i dont believe he ever thought it was that he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops of water and when they did not he was appalled he tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed a shudder passed through peter and he sat on the floor and cried his sobs woke wendy and she sat up in bed she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interested boy she said courteously why are you crying peter could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her beautifully she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bed whats your name he asked wendy moira angela darling she replied with some satisfaction what is your name peter pan she was already sure that he must be peter but it did seem a comparatively short name is that all yes he said rather sharply he felt for the first time that it was a shortish name im so sorry said wendy moira angela it doesnt matter peter gulped she asked where he lived second to the right said peter and then straight on till morning what a funny address peter had a sinking for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address no it isnt he said i mean wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess is that what they put on the letters he wished she had not mentioned letters dont get any letters he said contemptuously but your mother gets letters dont have a mother he said not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one he thought them very overrated persons wendy however felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy o peter no wonder you were crying she said and got out of bed and ran to him i wasnt crying about mothers he said rather indignantly i was crying because i cant get my shadow to stick on besides i wasnt crying it has come off yes then wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled and she was frightfully sorry for peter how awful she said but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap how exactly like a boy fortunately she knew at once what to do it must be sewn on she said just a little patronisingly whats sewn he asked youre dreadfully ignorant no im not but she was exulting in his ignorance i shall sew it on for you my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got out her housewife sewing bag and sewed the shadow on to peters foot i daresay it will hurt a little she warned him oh i shant cry said peter who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life and he clenched his teeth and did not cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little creased perhaps i should have ironed it wendy said thoughtfully but peter boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee alas he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to wendy he thought he had attached the shadow himself how clever i am he crowed rapturously oh the cleverness of me it is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter was one of his most fascinating qualities to put it with brutal frankness there never was a cockier boy but for the moment wendy was shocked you conceit braggart she exclaimed with frightful sarcasm of course i did nothing you did a little peter said carelessly and continued to dance a little she replied with hauteur pride if i am no use i can at least withdraw and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets to induce her to look up he pretended to be going away and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot wendy he said dont withdraw i cant help crowing wendy when im pleased with myself still she would not look up though she was listening eagerly wendy he continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist wendy one girl is more use than twenty boys now wendy was every inch a woman though there were not very many inches and she peeped out of the bedclothes do you really think so peter yes i do i think its perfectly sweet of you she declared and ill get up again and she sat with him on the side of the bed she also said she would give him a kiss if he liked but peter did not know what she meant and he held out his hand expectantly surely you know what a kiss is she asked aghast i shall know when you give it to me he replied stiffly and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble now said he shall i give you a kiss and she replied with a slight primness if you please she made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her life when people in our set are introduced it is customary for them to ask each others age and so wendy who always liked to do the correct thing asked peter how old he was it was not really a happy question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks grammar when what you want to be asked is kings of england i dont know he replied uneasily but i am quite young he really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at a venture wendy i ran away the day i was born wendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the charming drawingroom manner by a touch on her nightgown that he could sit nearer her it was because i heard father and mother he explained in a low voice talking about what i was to be when i became a man he was extraordinarily agitated now i dont want ever to be a man he said with passion i want always to be a little boy and to have fun so i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies she gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he knew fairies wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful she poured out questions about them to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his way and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding spanking still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairies you see wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies tedious talk this but being a stayathome she liked it and so he went on goodnaturedly there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl ought to be isnt there no you see children know such a lot now they soon dont believe in fairies and every time a child says i dont believe in fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead really he thought they had now talked enough about fairies and it struck him that tinker bell was keeping very quiet i cant think where she has gone to he said rising and he called tink by name wendys heart went flutter with a sudden thrill peter she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room she was here just now he said a little impatiently you dont hear her do you and they both listened the only sound i hear said wendy is like a tinkle of bells well thats tink thats the fairy language i think i hear her too the sound came from the chest of drawers and peter made a merry face no one could ever look quite so merry as peter and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh he had his first laugh still wendy he whispered gleefully i do believe i shut her up in the drawer he let poor tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury you shouldnt say such things peter retorted of course im very sorry but how could i know you were in the drawer wendy was not listening to him o peter she cried if she would only stand still and let me see her they hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock o the lovely she cried though tinks face was still distorted with passion tink said peter amiably this lady says she wishes you were her fairy tinker bell answered insolently what does she say peter he had to translate she is not very polite she says you are a great huge ugly girl and that she is my fairy he tried to argue with tink you know you cant be my fairy tink because i am an gentleman and you are a lady to this tink replied in these words you silly ass and disappeared into the bathroom she is quite a common fairy peter explained apologetically she is called tinker bell because she mends the pots and kettles tinker tin worker similar to cinder plus elle to get cinderella they were together in the armchair by this time and wendy plied him with more questions if you dont live in kensington gardens now sometimes i do still but where do you live mostly now with the lost boys who are they they are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way if they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses im captain what fun it must be yes said cunning peter but we are rather lonely you see we have no female companionship are none of the others girls oh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their prams this flattered wendy immensely i think she said it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls john there just despises us for reply peter rose and kicked john out of bed blankets and all one kick this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house however john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there and i know you meant to be kind she said relenting so you may give me a kiss for the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses i thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered to return her the thimble oh dear said the nice wendy i dont mean a kiss i mean a thimble whats that its like this she kissed him funny said peter gravely now shall i give you a thimble if you wish to said wendy keeping her head erect this time peter thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched what is it wendy it was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair that must have been tink i never knew her so naughty before and indeed tink was darting about again using offensive language she says she will do that to you wendy every time i give you a thimble but why why tink again tink replied you silly ass peter could not understand why but wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories you see i dont know any stories none of the lost boys knows any stories how perfectly awful wendy said do you know peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of houses it is to listen to the stories o wendy your mother was telling you such a lovely story which story was it about the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass slipper peter said wendy excitedly that was cinderella and he found her and they lived happily ever after peter was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been sitting and hurried to the window where are you going she cried with misgiving to tell the other boys dont go peter she entreated i know such lots of stories those were her precise words so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him he came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her but did not oh the stories i could tell to the boys she cried and then peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window let me go she ordered him wendy do come with me and tell the other boys of course she was very pleased to be asked but she said oh dear i cant think of mummy besides i cant fly ill teach you oh how lovely to fly ill teach you how to jump on the winds back and then away we go oo she exclaimed rapturously wendy wendy when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars oo and wendy there are mermaids mermaids with tails such long tails oh cried wendy to see a mermaid he had become frightfully cunning wendy he said how we should all respect you she was wriggling her body in distress it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor but he had no pity for her wendy he said the sly one you could tuck us in at night oo none of us has ever been tucked in at night oo and her arms went out to him and you could darn our clothes and make pockets for us none of us has any pockets how could she resist of course its awfully fascinating she cried peter would you teach john and michael to fly too if you like he said indifferently and she ran to john and michael and shook them wake up she cried peter pan has come and he is to teach us to fly john rubbed his eyes then i shall get up he said of course he was on the floor already hallo he said i am up michael was up by this time also looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw but peter suddenly signed silence their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grownup world all was as still as salt then everything was right no stop everything was wrong nana who had been barking distressfully all the evening was quiet now it was her silence they had heard out with the light hide quick cried john taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure and thus when liza entered holding nana the nursery seemed quite its old self very dark and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept they were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains liza was in a bad temper for she was mixing the christmas puddings in the kitchen and had been drawn from them with a raisin still on her cheek by nanas absurd suspicions she thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment but in custody of course there you suspicious brute she said not sorry that nana was in disgrace they are perfectly safe arent they every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed listen to their gentle breathing here michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected nana knew that kind of breathing and she tried to drag herself out of lizas clutches but liza was dense no more of it nana she said sternly pulling her out of the room i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party and then oh wont master whip you just she tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased to bark bring master and missus home from the party why that was just what she wanted do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe unfortunately liza returned to her puddings and nana seeing that no help would come from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it in another moment she had burst into the diningroom of and flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a communication mr and mrs darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery and without a goodbye to their hostess they rushed into the street but it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minutes we now return to the nursery its all right john announced emerging from his hidingplace i say peter can you really fly instead of troubling to answer him peter flew around the room taking the mantelpiece on the way how topping said john and michael how sweet cried wendy yes im sweet oh i am sweet said peter forgetting his manners again it looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds but they always went down instead of up i say how do you do it asked john rubbing his knee he was quite a practical boy you just think lovely wonderful thoughts peter explained and they lift you up in the air he showed them again youre so nippy at it john said couldnt you do it very slowly once peter did it both slowly and quickly ive got it now wendy cried john but soon he found he had not not one of them could fly an inch though even michael was in words of two syllables and peter did not know a from z of course peter had been trifling with them for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him fortunately as we have mentioned one of his hands was messy with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb results now just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let go they were all on their beds and gallant michael let go first he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the room i flewed he screamed while still in midair john let go and met wendy near the bathroom oh lovely oh ripping look at me look at me look at me they were not nearly so elegant as peter they could not help kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and there is almost nothing so delicious as that peter gave wendy a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indignant up and down they went and round and round heavenly was wendys word i say cried john why shouldnt we all go out of course it was to this that peter had been luring them michael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles but wendy hesitated mermaids said peter again oo and there are pirates pirates cried john seizing his sunday hat let us go at once it was just at this moment that mr and mrs darling hurried with nana out of they ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and yes it was still shut but the room was ablaze with light and most heartgripping sight of all they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round not on the floor but in the air not three figures four in a tremble they opened the street door mr darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs darling signed him to go softly she even tried to make her heart go softly will they reach the nursery in time if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them once again the stars blew the window open and that smallest star of all called out cave peter then peter knew that there was not a moment to lose come he cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by john and michael and wendy mr and mrs darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late the birds were flown
